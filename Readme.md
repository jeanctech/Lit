## What is Lit?

Lit is a simple library for building fast, lightweight web components.At Lit's core is a boilerplate-killing component base class that provides reactive state, scoped styles, and a declarative template system that's tiny, fast and expressive.

* [Lesson 30 - Conclusions](Conclusions)
* [Next Steps](Next-Steps)

## Introduction

The first thing to know about Lit is that every Lit component is a standard web component. Web components have the superpower of interoperability: natively supported by browsers, web components can be used in any HTML environment, with any framework or none at all.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
